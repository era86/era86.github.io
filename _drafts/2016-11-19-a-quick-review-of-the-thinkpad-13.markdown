Back in April, I purchased a Macbook to take around with me during my month-long trip across Europe. Its portability and light weight were the main draws, making it really easy to carry around along with my clothes in a 40-liter backpack.

However, after I returned from my trip, I found the Macbook less useful for things like streaming video, writing code in Vim, running VMs, or playing even the simplest of games (ex. Minecraft). Turns out, I need a bit more juice in my daily driver than the Macbook can offer.

Enter, the **Thinkpad 13**!

Once you own a Thinkpad, it's very difficult to use any other type of laptop. The keyboard (yes, even the chiclet one) is extremely comfortable. The Trackpoint makes mouse navigation very efficient, especially since your fingers never really have to leave home row. Best of all, Linux support is excellent, making Thinkpads great software development machines.

There are plenty of great reviews out there for the Thinkpad 13, but I decided to quickly review some of the characteristics of the laptop I found particularly important to me. As I briefly mentioned above, here is what I needed my daily driver to be capable of:

* Running one or two virtual machines via Vagrant/Virtualbox
* Comfortably provide enough screen real-estate for writing code
* Streaming high-quality music or HD video without lagging the entire operating system
* Playing simple games at low to medium settings
* Being light enough to carry on a short walk or bus ride

# My Configuration

Total price, including shipping and tax: **$870.11**

# Size and Weight

Like many web developers in Seattle, I enjoy getting out and writing code or browsing Hacker News at local coffee shops. For this, I needed a laptop that wouldn't be too heavy or bulky to carry around in my backpack.

The Macbook was perfect in this regard, in that it was extremely thin and light. Prior to that, I was lugging around an Thinkpad X220 with an extended battery pack. The Thinkpad 13 is a nice middle-ground between the two in terms of size.

**Macbook Dimensions**

* Height: 0.14–0.52 inches
* Width: 11.04 inches
* Depth: 7.74 inches
* Weight: 2.03 pounds

**Thinkpad X220 Dimensions**

* Height: 0.5–1.5 inches
* Width: 12 inches 
* Depth: 9.1 inces
* Weight: 4 pounds

**Thinkpad 13 Dimensions**

* Height: 0.78 inches
* Width: 12.69 inches
* Depth: 8.77 inches
* Weight: 3.17 pounds

# Keyboard

I really enjoyed the classic keyboard on the Thinkpad X220. When I moved on to the "butterfly" keys on the Macbook, it was quite a shock. Personally, I find the keyboard on the Macbook absolutely horrendous. It feels like each keystroke is a miniature mouse click.

The Thinkpad 13 keyboard is a breath of fresh air compared to the Macbook, but isn't quite as comfortable as the X220 keyboard. I wasn't too fond of Lenovo going the route of the chiclet keys, but I actually don't mind it as much as I thought I would. In fact, I barely notice the difference in travel between the Thinkpad 13 and X220.

There's a decent amount of resistance on the Thinkpad 13 keys, providing a good amount of feedback. However, I do occasionally find myself accidentally pushing keys while resting my hands on home row. It could be my fat and lazy hands, but I never really had that problem on the X220 or Macbook. 

One thing I knew I'd be missing from my Macbook was the backlit keyboard. I rarely use my Thinkpad 13 in dim or dark settings, but when I do, I sometimes have difficulty hunting for the function keys (ex. volume or brightness). For the rest of the keyboard, I do just fine in the dark.

# Trackpad and Trackpoint

It's undeniable, the Macbook (and almost any Apple laptop) has the best trackpad in the industry. Nothing comes even remotely close to it! The trackpad on the X220 is absolutely terrible. It has some kind of bumpy-textured finish on it, which doesn't improve its function and makes it unpleasant on the fingers. 

The Thinkpad 13 trackpad functions about as well as any other laptop in its class. Compared to the X220, it is much larger and and has a nice, smooth finish. It doesn't function or feel as good as the premium glass trackpad of the Macbook, but the it's definitely refreshing to use compared to the tiny, bumpy trackpad on the X220.

While it's trackpad is nice, most Thinkpad owners find pleasure in using the class trackpoint or "nub" in the middle of the keyboard. Unsurprisingly, the trackpoint on the Thinkpad 13 delivers an accurate and precise point-and-click experience. The buttons are much more clicky than the buttons on the X220, but that may be due to wear-and-tear. Only time will tell whether the Thinkpad 13's trackpoint buttons will continue to provide the feedback they currently do.

# Display

The IPS LED "Retina" display on the Macbook is pretty much the cream of the crop when it comes to laptop display technology. While its pixel-dense sharpness is really nice to have, I always try to fit as many lines of text on the screen as possible. Yes, I know this ends up with some really small letters on the screen, but I value screen real-estate a bit more than some people.

The 1440 x 900 resolution on the Macbook was a definite upgrade from the meager 1366 x 768 on the X220, but the "FHD" 1920 x 1080 on the Thinkpad 13 is absolutely wonderful to work on! It's nice to be able to watch videos in full 1080p. Not to mention the amount of lines of code I can fit in a single terminal session!

It's worth noting that I do see some lightbleed at the bottom of the screen right along the bottom bezel just above the hinges. It's hardly noticeable with stuff on the screen, but when booting, I can definitely see it.

# Performance

As I mentioned above, one of the real issues I had with my Macbook and X220 is having enough power to multitask. At any given moment, I have the following applications up and running:

* Chrome with many tabs open
* an Ubuntu virtual machine running Jekyll or Rails
* several terminal sessions
* Spotify on "High Quality" mode

Rarely is CPU ever really an issue in this particular situation, but the Intel Core M CPU in the Macbook was obviously a bottleneck. Even with 8 GB of RAM, OSX would come to a slow crawl with all these applications running. In fairness, the Macbook was never meant to handle this much work.

The X220, with its Intel Core i5-2520M CPU faired a bit better, but with only 4 GB of RAM, it could only handle so much at one time. Yes, I could have upgraded the memory to the maximum of 16 GB, but at this point, I was ready for some DDR4 action and the 6th generation of Intel CPUs.

The Thinkpad 13 can be configured up to 16 GB of memory, but the CPU and bridge combo of the Intel Core i5-6300U supports a maximum of 32 GB! I figured, why not just max out the memory? I ended up purchasing and installing the Ballistix Sport LT 32GB Kit by Crucial.

So, as I type this blog post in Vim, I'm listening to Spotify, browsing several Chrome tabs, and running a Vagrant VM serving Jekyll. All without a single hiccup or stutter!

# Battery Life

The X220, with it's extended 9-cell battery pack, gave me an average of 12 hours normal use per charge. "Normal use" for me is browsing the web and streaming music. I never really had to worry about running out of power while out and about without my charger.

During my backpacking trip through Europe, my Macbook would give me about 5 hours of normal use on a single charge. However, with a bit more heavy use back at home, I get closer to 4 hours. It's not terrible, but it's nowhere near what I was getting on my X220.

The Thinkpad 13 gives me roughly the same amount of hourly use that my Macbook gave: right around 5 hours. It's absolutely wonderful, considering the amount of CPU performance I'm utilizing.

# Final Thoughts

The Thinkpad 13 is probably one of the best bang-for-buck laptops currently available on the market. It isn't the quad-core software development powerhouse that is the Apple Macbook Pro or Dell XPS 15, but it can get the job done for most programmers. Quite honestly, it'd be hard to find a laptop that isn't suitable for most software development these days.

The chiclet style keyboard on the new Thinkpads provide fairly decent feedback and travel. It may not be the classic keyboard of generations past, but it's still better than many other laptops in the same price-range.

For someone looking to move on from trusty X220, the Thinkpad 13 an excellent choice!
