In 2016, I purchased a [Thinkpad 13]() to replace my MacBook. Unfortunately, I ran into issues with battery life and its suspend functionality in Ubuntu. I also found the Thinkpad 13 chassis quite flimsy, flexible, and outright "cheap". This made it really hard for travel, since I needed to be able to pack it tightly into my backpack while on the road. I simply didn't trust the chassis ability to withstand the punishment.

Last September, I decided to move on from the Thinkpad 13. At the time, there were many laptops on the market that fit my requirements. After a couple weeks of shopping around, I eventually pulled the trigger on a [Asus ZenBook 3]().

The ZenBook 3 has more than enough power to do some of the basic tasks I require: streaming video, writing code, running VMs, and playing Stardew Valley. It also features an extremely slim aluminum chassis (very similar to the MacBook), sturdy enough to withstand any type of flex forced upon it.

It's been a couple of months, now. So, I decided to write a quick review of my thoughts on the laptop.

# Helpful Reviews

*Disclaimer:* This particular write-up isn't a comprehensive review of the Asus ZenBook 3. It's a quick summary of my thoughts and an opportunity to answer any questions folks may have.

There are plenty of great, detailed reviews out there. These were particularly helpful in making my decision to buy one:

* [Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA Review by Mobile Tech Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFnrrQCmg8k)
* [Asus ZenBook 3 Review by Laptop Mag](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/asus-zenbook-3)
* [Asus ZenBook 3 Review by Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/05/asus-zenbook-3-review/)

I highly recommend giving all of these a read/watch!

# My Configuration

Here is what I need my daily driver laptop to be capable of: 

* Running one or two virtual machines via [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Displaying a decent amount of code on the screen
* Streaming HQ music or HD video without lagging the entire system
* Playing simple games at low to medium settings
* Being slim and sturdy enough to stuff in my backpack for traveling
* Charge with a USB-C port (so I can charge my phone with the same charger)

Based on my requirements, I opted for the lower Intel Core i5  model (UX390UA-DH51-GR):

| Processor          | Intel Core i5-7200U KabyLake CPU
| Operating System   | Ubuntu 16.04 (dual boot w/ Windows 10 Home 64)
| Memory             | 8GB LPDDR3 Onboard RAM 
| Graphics           | Intel HD Graphics 620
| Battery            | 6cells 40Wh Polymer Battery
| Fingerprint Reader | Included
| Camera             | 1.2MP VGA Webcam
| Storage            | 256GB Flash Memory Solid State
| Wireless           | Integrated 802.11 A/C, Bluetooth 4.0
| Display Panel      | 12.5" (16:9) FHD (1920x1080) 60Hz Anti-Glare Panel 72% NTSC
| Price              | $742.99

# Size and Weight

Most of my laptop-usage happens on my couch. Occasionally, I'll throw my computer in a bag and head to a coffee shop, but it's few and far-between. While I'm no road-warrior, I still need my laptop to be slim and sturdy enough to cram into my 40-liter REI backpack when I fly overseas.

I recently took my ZenBook 3 on a two-week trip to the Philippines and it was the perfect companion! It actually came with a nice, light-weight case to protect it.

# Keyboard

[![](/assets/images/posts/asus-keyboard.png){: .bordered }](/assets/images/posts/asus-keyboard.png)

The ZenBook 3 has a low-profile, illuminated chiclet keyboard. While it isn't anywhere near as comfortable as the Thinkpad 13 (or any Thinkpad for that matter), it isn't as horrendous as the "butterfly" keys on the MacBook.

[![](/assets/images/posts/asus-keyboard-vs-x220.png){: .bordered }](/assets/images/posts/asus-keyboard-vs-x220.png)

I did, however, find that without a hard enough key-press, the Asus wouldn't register certain keys. This turned out to be very annoying, since it forced me to "bottom out" quite hard on each key, which kind of defeats the purpose of a low-profile keyboard. The layout on the ZenBook 3 has the `Ctrl` key in the far, bottom-left corner. This means, compared to any Thinkpad or Apple laptop, the `Fn` and `Ctrl` keys are swapped. It's subtle, but the difference in layout made for a cognitive annoyance when switching laptops.

# Trackpad

The trackpad on the ZenBook 3 has a good amount of real-estate kj

# Display

The IPS LED "Retina" display on the Macbook is pretty much the cream of the crop when it comes to laptop display technology. While its pixel-dense sharpness is really nice to have, I always try to fit as many lines of text on the screen as possible. Yes, I know this ends up with some really small text, but I value screen real-estate a bit more than other people might.

[![](/assets/images/posts/asus-display-colors.png){: .bordered }](/assets/images/posts/asus-display-colors.png)

The 1440 x 900 resolution on the Macbook is a definite upgrade from the meager 1366 x 768 on the X220, but the "FHD" 1920 x 1080 on the Thinkpad 13 is wonderful to work on! It's nice to be able to watch videos in full 1080p. It also gives me plenty of vertical space to fit as much text on the screen as possible.

[![](/assets/images/posts/asus-display-lines.png){: .bordered }](/assets/images/posts/asus-display-lines.png)

It's worth noting that I do see some lightbleed at the bottom of the screen right along the bottom bezel, just above the hinges. It's hardly noticeable with stuff on the screen, but when the screen is black, I can definitely see it.

# Performance

As I mentioned above, one of the real issues I have with my Macbook and X220 is having enough power to multitask. At any given moment, I have the following applications up and running:

* Chrome with many tabs open
* an Ubuntu virtual machine running Jekyll or Rails
* several terminal sessions
* Spotify on "High Quality" mode

Rarely is CPU ever really an issue in this particular situation, but the Intel Core M CPU in the Macbook is obviously a bottleneck. Even with 8 GB of RAM, OS X comes to a slow crawl with all these applications running. In fairness, I don't think the Macbook was never really designed to handle this much work.

The X220, with its Intel Core i5-2520M CPU fairs a bit better, but it's pushed to 100% full load. This makes the laptop run extremely hot. It also only has 4 GB of RAM, which isn't much.

The Thinkpad 13 can be configured on the Lenovo website up to 16 GB of memory, but the Intel Core i5-6300U supports a maximum of 32 GB! I figured, why not just max out the memory? I ended up purchasing and installing the [Crucial Ballistix Sport LT 32GB Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DGOF3E4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00). I found [Crucial's Upgrade Compatibility page](http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/Lenovo/thinkpad-13) useful for finding this particular kit.

So, as I type this blog post in Vim, I'm listening to Spotify, browsing several Chrome tabs, and running a Vagrant VM serving Jekyll. All without a single hiccup or stutter!

# Battery Life

[![](/assets/images/posts/asus-charging.png){: .bordered }](/assets/images/posts/asus-charging.png)

Battery life isn't as important to me as some road warriors out there, but the ability to be away from the plug is a nice convenience. Based on the usage I've described above, my Thinkpad 13 gives me an average of 5 hours of usage per charge. Keep in mind, I run [Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/) as my main operating system. If history is any indication, I'm sure Windows is a bit more power-efficient.


# Final Thoughts

The Thinkpad 13 is probably one of the best, bang-for-buck laptops currently available on the market. It isn't the quad-core software development powerhouse that is the [Apple Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro) or [Dell XPS 15](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/productdetails/xps-15-9550-laptop), but it gets the job done for most programmers out there. Quite honestly, it'd be hard to find a laptop that *isn't* suitable for programming these days.

For someone looking for a no-frills, inexpensive daily driver, the Thinkpad 13 an excellent choice!
