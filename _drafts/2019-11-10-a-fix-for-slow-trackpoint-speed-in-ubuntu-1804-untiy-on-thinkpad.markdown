## They force you to improve your onboarding process, or create one

- onboarding is important for getting all engineers up to speed quickly
- it's often seen as a bit of a roadblock to becoming productive
- the process expedites the boilerplate of getting a machine set up
- the amount of detail required depends on the level of experience of the onboarding engineer

- an E1 requires a bit more detail and hand-holding than more experienced engineers
- this forces onboarding documentation and process to be more polished
  - introduce onboarding scripts
  - use Docker or Vagrant (VMs) to quickly get dev envs up
  - step-by-step documentation that's easy to read for brand new engineers
    - without too much detail, details can be added/explained later 

## They bring in fresh perspectives and approaches, helping team avoid tunnel visoin

- it's common for an engineering team to get trapped in the ways things are done
- the company culture is often a reflection of the people
- frameworks, services, and programming paradigms are sometimes blindly followed because "that's the way it's done"

- fresh eyes can often break teams out of tunnel vision
- often times, E1s will ask "why?" and it forces more experienced developers to _really_ think, "why do we do it that way?"

## They force you to re-learn important software engineering basics
## They force you to fortify your principals in order to explain "why something is done the way it is"

- after many years, important foundational comp sci basics can be forgotten
- after all, we work in the "real world" where practicality often trumps theory
- however, some of those basic principles are important and would benefit everyone if they were remembered

- E1s can sometimes serve as a refresher of basic ideas that get forgotten
  - it's fresh on their minds, so they can better express foundational principles
  - it's unknown to them, so it requires some teaching, which forces you to relearn and teach (fortifying your own knowledge)
- the ability to communicate and teach ideas _effectively_ is an important aspect of senior-level engineers
  - effective teachers are effective knowledge-spreaders, this build effective teams _quicker_

## They re-ignite excitement and inspiration to learn new things, often a benefit for senior engineers jaded by the industry

- working in software long enough, the job wears and tears
  - same old code, same old stack
  - same old processes
- teaching someone software engineering fundamentals allows us to revisit our younger/former selves
- their eagerness and willingness to learn reminds us what it was like to come in with bright eyes and open minds
- it's inspirational, motivating us to continue learning and growing
