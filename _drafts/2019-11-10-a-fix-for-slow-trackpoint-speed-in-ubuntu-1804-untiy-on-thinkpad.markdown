## They encourage teams to improve (or create) an onboarding process

Onboarding is the process of getting a new engineer up and working _quickly_.
This includes setting up the local development environment and installing tools
like Slack or Github. The main goal is to get the engineer prepared to do work
as soon as possible.

The lack of proper onboarding becomes very apparent when a junior engineer joins
the team, as he/she usually needs more guidance than experienced engineers. For
example, if step-by-step documentation isn't detailed enough, a new engineer may
flounder trying to follow along. On the other hand, if documentation is _too_
verbose, it may make the engineer feel like he/she is drinking from a firehose.

This is also be a good time to introduce automation with scripts or tools like
Docker. Although it may hide some of the finer details about the environment
from a junior engineer, it can reduce the amount of boilerplate required to get
started with the important parts, like code.

Regardless of the team's approach to onboarding, the fresh eyes of a junior
engineer are very useful in improving the overall process.


## They force senior engineers to revisit software engineering fundamentals

After some time working in the tech industry, a developer learns some basic
fundamentals about software engineering. Basic programming paradigms, usually in
the form of acroynms (MVC, REST, SOLID, etc.), are typically learned on the job.
Engineering practices like sprints, retros, and standups are also most commonly
learned in an industry setting rather than an academic one.

Junior engineers coming in with no prior experience with these industry basics
are expected to learn them from senior members of the team. It's essential for
senior engineers to be able to answer the _why_ in addition to the _what_. For
example, it's not enough to explain _what_ composition over inheritence means,
but _why_ it's something that's preferred.

If senior engineers find themselves stumped by _why_ questions, it might be a
good time to revisit and relearn some of these key fundamentals. It isn't
required to be an expert on any particular topic, but it should be expected to
have enough knowledge to _teach_ key concepts. Not only does this help pass on
information to junior engineers, it reinforces and fortifies this knowledge
within senior engineers as well.

The ability to communicate and teach ideas is an important part of being a
senior engineer. Having junior engineers on a team allows them to exercise their 
mentorship skills while staying fresh in key concepts themselves.

## They re-ignite the excitement to grow and learn

- working in software long enough, the job wears and tears
  - same old code, same old stack
  - same old processes
- teaching someone software engineering fundamentals allows us to revisit our younger/former selves
- their eagerness and willingness to learn reminds us what it was like to come in with bright eyes and open minds
- it's inspirational, motivating us to continue learning and growing
