It's hard enough to interview and hire good software engineers. It's even harder to keep them engaged, productive, and willing to stick around. There are definitely ups and downs to any job, and being a software engineer is no different. Sometimes, the downs get overwhelming, leading to great engineers looking for work elsewhere. 

In the ten years I've worked in software, I've seen several engineers come and go. When they go, it's often because they've found themselves unhappy in their current role. Developer happiness usually falls on the responsibility of management, but it's definitely a two-way street.

Here are some of the common reasons I've witnessed contributing to developer grief and some of the best ways I've seen them addressed.

### "I'm in nothing but meetings all day"

As engineers of software, we expect to spend most of our time writing code. Yes, meetings are essential for the dispersal of information and gathering of ideas, but **we truly value our heads-down, programming time**. There's a balance to be found, but if the pendulum swings too far into meeting-land, we quickly lose interest or feel like we've lost our way.

To combat this, I've seen engineers mute email notifications or snooze Slack for blocks at a time to prevent those interruptions throughout the day. I've seen others go so far as adding blocks of "Do Not Disturb" events to their calendars.

One effective strategy is to get the team together and establish a "Work From Home" or "No Meeting" day (both, if you're lucky). This empowers everyone to focus and get things done, uninterrupted.

The important thing is **to be _explicit_ about setting aside time to work on code**. Meetings have explicit times and locations, so should your programming time!

### "All I ever work on are bugs"

Everybody wants to feel like they're making an impact at work. Very few want to be a tiny cog in a large machine. **Building new features is one of the most _direct_ ways we contribute to a company**. However, we're also expected to keep things up and running, and that means squashing bugs. Debugging and fixing old code isn't always thrilling. It's draining, making us feel like we're not _adding_ value.

With the exception of _really_ small startups, there are decision-makers outside of the engineering team who work on developing new features.

A great way to implement Sometimes, it takes a bit more  be more involved in feature-planning, interact with product, get in the know of what's coming and be involved

If you want to work on more greenfield products, **be more involved in the early stages of feature-planning**.


### "I haven't learned anything new"

Continuous growth and development is extremely important to all engineers. In the software industry, technologies change _very_ quickly, and we don't want to be left behind. Being in a constant state of learning is essential to our careers and mental well-being. **If we don't take time to explore and learn, we may find ourselves too complacent, uninspired, or maybe even obsolete**.

Some of the best employers in my area place a high value on the education of their engineers. This comes in many forms, big and small. I've work on teams who host local meetups or lunch-and-learn presentations. One year, my entire team was sent to a Ruby on Rails conference for a weekend! Events like these give engineers a chance to learn, but they also serve as great team-building, morale-boosting opportunities.

Resources may vary, but **it's important to invest _some_ level of time or money into the education of engineering teams**. An exercised brain is a happy and productive one!

### "I no longer feel valued for my work"

For many, salary is the best way to determine the "value" of an engineer. In fact, most engineers are perfectly fine with their jobs as long as the pay meets their needs, and there's absolutely _nothing_ wrong with that.

However, there are many ways to show engeineers they are valued.

an engineer to acknowldgeIt comes in many forms, Some seek out job titles. Others like awards. Most prefer to receive pay-raises.  This isn't unique to software developers, _everyone_ wants to feel like their contributions are wanted and .

Acknowledgement goes a long way, however big or small it may be. And it should come from all angles, managers _and_ co-workers alike. If someone does something good, ping them with a "thumbs-up" emoji.  If someone makes a mistake, be constructive. Constructive criticism is also a form of showing that you value a person.

Don't forget, be willing to give and _receive_ compliments. Valuing yourself helps immensely in your own happiness.

At the heart of it, **many of us just want to be _appreciated_ for the work we do**. It never hurts to give a pat on the back when someone does a good job!
