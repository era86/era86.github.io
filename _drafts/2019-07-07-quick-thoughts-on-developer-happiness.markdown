It's been about ten years since I graduated college and joined the workforce. Since then, I've worked at several companies, small and large. Most of the time, my colleagues remained the same. However, I've seen plenty of engineers come and go. Some moved on to better opportunities. Others simply wanted to move on from the company.

There's plenty of talk in our industry about "developer happiness". It's hard enough to interview and hire good engineers. It's even _harder_ to keep them engaged, productive, and willing to stay.

Here are some reasons I've seen or experienced contributing to the unhappiness of software developers.


### "I'm in nothing but meetings all day"

As engineers of software, we expect to spend most of our time writing code. Meetings are essential for efficiently sharing information, but **we truly value our programming time**. There's a balance to be found, but if the pendulum swings too far into meeting-land, we quickly lose interest or feel like we've lost our way.

To combat this, **it's important to _explicitly_ set aside time to work on code**. Some senior developers I've worked with went so far as to add blocks of "do not disturb" events to their calendars. Another strategy I've seen is establishing a "work from home" or "no meeting" day, which empowers the whole team to go heads-down and get things done, uninterrupted.

### "All I ever work on are bugs"

Everybody wants to feel like they're making an impact at work. Very few engineers want to feel like a tiny cog in a machine. **Building new features is one of the most _direct_ ways we contribute to a product or service**. However, we're also expected to keep things up and running. Bug-fixing is absolutely essential, but not too thrilling. Sifting through and debugging old code is exhausting. It gets old. It can make us feel like we're not _adding_ value.

Feeling trapped in a pile of bugs is often self-inflicted. Likely, the most experienced engineers are able to fix bugs the fastest. However, we have to remember we are part of a _team_, and bug-work must be shared. On a similar note, everyone on the team should have opportunities to work on greenfield projects.

**While sharing of work is often faciliated by managers, we must be vigilant about it ourselves**. New projects in the pipeline? Be upfront about jumping on the ones that interest you. Bug triage getting overwhelming? Delegate work to others rather than going it alone.

### "I haven't learned anything new"

Growth and development is extremely important to all engineers. In the software industry, technologies change around us _very_ quickly. Being in a constant state of learning is essential to our careers and mental well-being. **If we don't take time to explore and learn, we may find ourselves too comfortable, complacent, and uninspired**.

In my experience, the best companies place a high value on the education of their engineers. This comes in the form of hosting local meetups or weekly lunch-and-learn presentations. One year, my entire team was sent to a Ruby on Rails conference for a weekend!

While resources may vary, **it's important to invest _some_ level of time or money in the education of software engineers**. An exercised brain is a happy one!

### "I no longer feel valued for my work"

This is a tricky one to address because "being valued" varies wildly depending on the engineer. Some find value in job titles. Others like awards. Most prefer to receive pay-raises. At the heart of it, many of us just want to be _appreciated_ for the work we do. This isn't unique to software developers, _everyone_ wants to feel like they're contributing.

Acknowledgement goes a long way, however big or small it may be. And it should come from all angles, managers _and_ co-workers alike. If someone does something good, ping them with a "thumbs-up" emoji.  If someone makes a mistake, be constructive. Constructive criticism is also a form of showing that you value a person.

Don't forget, be willing to give and _receive_ compliments. Valuing yourself helps immensely in your own happiness.
