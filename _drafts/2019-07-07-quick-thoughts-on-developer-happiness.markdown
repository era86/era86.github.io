It's been about ten years since I graduated college and joined the software development workforce. In that time, I've worked at several companies, small and large, with co-workers at several levels of experience. Most of the time, my engineering teams remained the same. However, I've seen a lot of engineers come and go, for many reasons. Some moved on to better opportunities. Others simply wanted to move on from the company.

There's plenty of talk in our industry about developer happiness. It's hard enough to interview and hire good engineers. It's even harder to keep them engaged, productive, and willing to stay with the company.

Here are a couple of reasons I've seen great engineers leave a company.

### "I'm in nothing but meetings all day"

As software engineers, we expect to spend most of our time writing code. Meetings are an essential part of efficient information-sharing, but we truly value our programming time. There's a balance to be found, but if the pendulum swings too far into process-land, we quickly lose interest or feel like we've lost our own way.

### "The manager who hired me left"

Normally, the manager who interviews you is the one who ends up becoming your boss. We have to remember, the interview is a two-way process. While the company is throwing FizzBuzz (hopefully not) our way, we're evaluating whether or not we can see ourselves working there. A huge part of this evaluation is our future boss. Will she micromanage me? Will I get chastised for making mistakes? Is he willing to mentor and invest in my growth as an engineer?

Once we've agreed to work with a new manager, it feels shaken when he/she leaves. As leadership changes, so does our career-path. If tihngs change frequently, our career feels a bit unstable. And it gets exhausting having to continuously repeat your own career goals to each and every new manager.

### "All I ever work on are bugs"

Building new features is our favorite way of making a direct impact on the success of a company. It's our goal to use our skills to improve the product or service we're selling. However, we know bugs are inevitable and we're going to have to set aside time to fix things.

Engineers who've been around at a company for awhile usually become "subject-matter experts" in various parts of the code. While anyone could technically fix bugs, they're usually the ones _fastest_ at doing so. So, they're the ones often called on to do the most bug work.

Maintaining the product is important, but it isn't too thrilling sifting through and debugging code all day. It's exhausting and doesn't quite feel like we're adding much value to the product.

### "I haven't learned anything new"

Growth and development is extremely important to all engineers. In the software industry, especially, the technologies around us change very quickly.
