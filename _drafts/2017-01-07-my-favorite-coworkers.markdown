Since about 2009, I've had the pleasure of working on several different software development teams. Each one came with it's own set of tools and methodologies, all contributing to my growth as a developer. However, while the "OOPs" and "TDDs" were great things to learn, some of the most impactful influences on my growth came from the characteristics of my co-workers.

# Boeing

During the summer of 2008, I was a software engineering intern at Boeing. Prior to my internship, I only ever worked on homework assignments and group projects. This was a great opportunity to see how things worked at a professional level.

As an intern, I expected to feel somewhat overlooked by the members of my team. After all, interns often get "busy work", so not to interfere with the "real work" being done. My project for the summer was to build a GUI tool in C and Python for analyzing large amounts of flight-test data. It wasn't part of the main repository, but it was a fun little project nonetheless.

I shared a cubicle with a senior software engineer, we'll call him Bill. Bill really took me under his wing throughout my internship. He helped me gather requirements, break down my tasks, and even gave me ideas on which features to add or remove. Now, I doubt my GUI tool was used very much, but Bill made me feel like I was actually contributing to the company. It was really nice to feel useful, even as a lowly intern.

# Maverick Label

My first job right out of college was at a label-printing shop. I joined a small team tasked with completely re-implementing an old PHP e-commerce website. The new website would be based on a Java framework. This was my first foray into professional web development, and soon realized just how little I knew about the web.

Eventually, we added another developer to the team, we'll call him Matt. Before Matt joined us, there weren't really any experienced software developers on site. Matt brought some order and direction to the project, which was very much needed on our small, inexperienced team.

I was completely new to web development. As a result, much of my code was very basic and naive. Matt was very opinionated and critical of the code I wrote, and he wasn't always tactful in letting me know. This made it really hard to work with Matt sometimes.

However, it was Matt who challenged me to keep learning, practicing, and improving as a software developer. He showed me that being in this industry wasn't just about writing code, but implementing efficient and elegant solutions.

# Navigating Cancer

Eventually, I left my first job to join a small engineering team at a healthcare startup. Here, I was introduced to Ruby on Rails by an experienced team of web developers.
