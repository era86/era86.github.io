I'll be honest. As a programmer, my mindset is usually more negative
than positive. I've accepted that my code, at some point, *will fail*
and the software I write will *never be complete*. As I'm planning out
projects, I'm usually thinking about the worst-case scenarios and
possible issues. I've been burned by ever-changing requirements from
clients who expect too much in too little time. So, sometimes it's hard
to trust anything the client says at all. \
\
 "Never". "Failure". "Worst". "Too much". "Too little". "Hard to trust".

### The Party Pooper Programmer

In my experience, some of the best programmers I've worked with exhibit
these "pessimistic" traits. In design meetings, they always cried out
over every possible issue or breakage. They were nit-picky over every
little detail, especially during code reviews and pairing sessions. They
were always skeptical of code deployed into production, even if it was
thoroughly tested and criticized. **Expecting the worst and being
critical of the details helped produce more complete and robust code.**
\
\
 Though this attitude is useful, and sometimes essential, for writing
good software, it isn't always appreciated outside of the office. I'm
sure we can all think of people who always seem to be "downers" or
"party poopers". Planning a hiking trip? They'll warn that it might
rain, snow, be too difficult, too easy, etc. Trying out a new
restaurant? Their food will be too salty, too sweet, too hot, or too
cold. Didn't ask for advice or an opinion? Chances are, they're giving
it anyway. \
\
Too critical. Too skeptical. Too pessimistic. A negative attitude. \

### The Positive Person

I know not every developer has this problem. We're usually pretty good
at separating our work and play. But I'm not afraid to admit it's
something I still struggle with from time to time. Leave the "programmer
pessimism" at the office. We can't treat life like we treat our code. We
will *not* always fail. Not *every* possible bad situation or issue
needs to be brought up and addressed. Have a little faith in others. Not
everyone needs or wants to be analyzed and criticized. **Outside of
work, turn on the positive attitude and look on the bright side!**\
