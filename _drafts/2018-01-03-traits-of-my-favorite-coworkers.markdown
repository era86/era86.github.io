Since about 2009, I've had the pleasure of working on several different engineering teams. Each one came with it's own set of tools and methodologies, all contributing to my growth as a developer. As with anyone in the field, I learned lots of "OOPs" and "TDDs" along the way. However, a lot of my growth was influenced by the characteristics of those around me.

Here's a couple of traits I found most admirable in my favorite co-workers:

## Cooperative

Many programmers take pride in being "lone rangers". If he/she is productive alone, why mess with it? The problem arises when this lone ranger goes on vacation (or quits) and others have to inherit his/her projects. It's actually quite productive to have more than one team member work in any particular part of the system.

Some of the best, senior developers I've worked with were willing to cooperate to solve problems rather than try to solve everything themselves. This was at every stage of the development process, from planning to programming. They were always bouncing ideas off of others as well as opening their own code to criticism.

## Tactful

Developers will always disagree with one another. It's a fact of life. I've found that it takes some skill to navigate the egos and biases of those you work with. Even if the conflict doesn't involved you directly, mediating between parties isn't always the easiest thing to do.

When conflicts arise, it's important to stay cool. My favorite team members used words like "we" instead of "I" or "you". They also remained as objective as possible, never resorting to personal attacks or "pulling rank". Not only did they get their point across, but they listened and addressed anyone else's thoughts or concerns.

## Curious

At this point in my career, work can get tedious. There are some days (or weeks, or months) where I feel jaded by work projects. Sure, it's fine to get into a groove with tools, frameworks, and programming languages, especially if you're productive in them. However, well-rounded developers often bring fresh programming paradigms and development strategies.

Learning new things can be uncomfortable and unfamiliar, but some of the best developers I've worked with were willing to explore uncharted waters. If time allowed (which is rare), they solved problems using new tools and languages, just for the sake of learning something new.

## Patient

Everybody makes mistakes, senior and junior developers alike. Failing tests and broken builds are an inevitable pain. They're even more painful when they affect other developers, teams, or the company as a whole. A workplace where punishment is tolerated will stifle communication, prevent risk-taking, and suppress new ideas.

I've worked in places where negative reinforcement was the game. If you broke the build,you were obliterated in chat or made to feel bad for doing so. This works for some people, but it left me afraid to ask for help, push code, or share ideas. I found myself, and those around me, growing and learning more when our senior developers were willing to put up with our "noobishness" (within reason). Even if I felt like my questions were stupid, I was never made to feel like they were. In code reviews and pair-programming sessions, I was never ridiculed or spoken-down upon.

# Empathy

Really, all of this amounts to being empathetic to others team members. In my opinion, the greatest software developers are empathetic
