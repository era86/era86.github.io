After many years on Google's [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) platform, I've decided to switch over to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The [old site is still up](http://www.runtime-era.blogspot.com), with all of my previous blog posts. However, any new content will be posted here.

There are several reasons I decided to leave Blogger. These are just the important few:

## More control of the overall design

The wonderful thing about Blogger is how easy it is to get a blog up and running. There are several default themes to choose from and they're all wonderfully designed. Once a theme is selected, it can be further tweaked. There are built-in tools for selecting colors, fonts, sizes, etc. 

However, doing anything more than colors and fonts requires some pretty hacky stuff. The built-in editor allows custom CSS to be dropped into the page, but it's all mixed in with a bunch of other crud generated by the chosen theme. Doing proper, well-organized CSS is simply out of the question.

Using Jekyll, **I'm able to build my layouts and styles from the barest HTML and CSS**. It's just a static website, afterall. I have complete control over every aspect of the site! If I want to be lazy, there are [a ton of other themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) I can choose from.

## Ability to write blog posts in several formats

Content is the absolute lifeblood of any blog. Although it helps to make things pretty, people visit blogs to *consume content*. Blogger provides a great tools for getting content out, including a basic WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. At first, I really enjoyed the workflow of writing text, saving, uploading a picture or two, then clicking "Publish" and watching it all go live.

The pain started when I wanted to change spacing, insert a `<table>`, or apply customer CSS classes. First of all, the code being generated by the WYSIWYG editor isn't exactly well-formatted HTML. We're talking inline styles, no indentation, etc.

Jekyll supports several different 

## Code highlighting, without hacks

## Much faster page loads

## Free hosting on Github Pages

For now, enjoy the new site!
