After many years on Google's [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) platform, I've decided to switch over to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The [old site is still up](http://www.runtime-era.blogspot.com), with all of my previous blog posts. However, any new content will be posted here.

There are several reasons I decided to leave Blogger. These are just the important few:

## More control of the overall design

The wonderful thing about Blogger is how easy it is to get a blog up and running. There are several default themes to choose from and they're all wonderfully designed. Once a theme is selected, it can be further tweaked. There are built-in tools for selecting colors, fonts, sizes, etc. 

However, doing anything more than colors and fonts requires some pretty hacky stuff. The built-in editor allows custom CSS to be dropped into the page, but it's all mixed in with a bunch of other crud generated by the chosen theme. Doing proper, well-organized CSS is simply out of the question.

Using Jekyll, **I'm able to build my layouts and styles from the barest HTML and CSS**. It's just a static website, afterall. I have complete control over every aspect of the site! If I want to be lazy, there are [a ton of other themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) I can choose from.

## Ability to write blog posts in several formats

As writers, our main goal is to *produce* interesting content for readers to *consume*. The purpose of our tools or frameworks is to allow us to quickly and easily deliver great content to our readers. Blogger provides great tools for cranking content out, including a basic WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor. With it, delivering content is as easy as writing, saving, uploading a picture or two, then clicking "Publish".

The pain starts when anything more than words or pictures need to be published. Even simple things, like inserting a `<table>` or applying custom CSS classes, require editing the HTML source outside of the WYSIWYG editor. Speaking of HTML source, the code generated by the WYSIWYG editor isn't very clean. We're talking inline styles, no indentation, etc.

Jekyll **supports the creation and delivery of content in [several different formats](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#converters-1)**. I prefer to deliver most of my articles in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). However, if I need to present more complex content, I can write it in raw HTML. Either way, I have more options on how to create content for readers!

## Code highlighting, without hacks

Blogger, by default, doesn't have code syntax highlighting built in. When I first started writing, I didn't think too much about it. As time when on, my posts began to incorporate more and more code. The lack of clean syntax highlighting became a major inconvenience.

I discovered a plugin called [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) written by [Alex Gorbatchev]() that allowed me to insert code snippets into my blog posts. However, getting the plugin into Blogger feels [completely hacky](http://www.mybloggertricks.com/2015/04/SyntaxHighlighter-Shortcode-for-Blogspot.html).

**With Jekyll, syntax highlighting is [built right in](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#highlighting-code-snippets)**. No third-party Javascript is required to transform the page on load. Since Jekyll uses [Pygments](http://pygments.org), it is capable of highlighting [tons of different programming languages](http://pygments.org/languages/).

## Pages load faster
Currently, my Blogger-hosted website loads between 1-2 seconds per page. This isn't too bad, but for something as simple as a blog (with no dynamic content), it's way slow. By inspecting the content flowing over from the web server to the browser, we can see how much stuff is being sent over the wire:

Since Jekyll is a static site generator, all of the content is generated *prior to deployment*. This means **my entire blog is a collection of pure, [static web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page)**. When the client makes a request for a blog post, there is no crazy content-rendering or database querying. A simple, pure HTML web page is sent, which takes an average of 500-600 milliseconds!

## Conclusion

Blogger is a good platform for those who are looking to deliver the simplest of content. There is a decent selection of themes and layouts that are, at the very least, pleasing to the eye. The WYSIWYG editor is adequate for delivering basic articles, with the option to edit HTML source directly.

However, for blogger who wants a fine-tuned experience in designing, creating, and delivering the best content to their readers, a static site generator like Jekyll is a *much* better option.
