 Zuckerberg wants to be left alone in The Social Network

\
 Interruptions are an ultimate killer of productivity for any software
developer. When writing code, everything from algorithms to variable
names are stored temporarily in the brain. If you are interrupted, your
brain is forced free up room in order to switch context. This knocks
bits and pieces of valuable programming information out of your head! \
\
 During the work day, programmers can achieve what I like to call the
**programming groove**. It's a [wonderful
place](http://decodingflow.com/what-developers-really-want/)! Ideas and
solutions flow elegantly from the mind, through the fingers, into the
keyboard, and out to the editor. Seemingly effortless. It can take up to
[half an
hour](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000068.html) of
uninterrupted work time to get into a programming groove. The slightest
interruption can completely derail a developer in this zone. Once
disrupted, he or she will likely take an *additional* thirty minutes to
get *back* into the groove. \
\
 You can stand up and tell everyone you don't want to be bothered. It's
the most straightforward solution. However, there are some slight visual
cues you can give others to show them you want to be left alone. Here
are a few that work for me: \
\

### Hands on the keyboard.

The *physical act* of programming is typing. You can go on about all the
brainstorming, architecting, and white-boarding that goes into software
development, but if you aren't physically typing, you aren't actually
programming. By keeping the fingers on home row, it shows you have a
solution brewing in mind and you're ready to execute a plan. People are
more hesitant to interrupt a programmer whose fingers are, quite
literally, on the trigger. \
\

### Back straight, body aimed forward.

More than half of all human communication is through body language. It's
important to maintain eye contact with the screen, but using the entire
body conveys even deeper focus. Always keep your shoulders and feet
square with the computer. Keep the back straight, don't slouch.
Slouching is a classic sign of boredom (or laziness) and it's [bad for
you](http://vimeo.com/71441709) anyway. Show everyone you're engaged,
intrigued, and directly focused on the code on the screen. \
\

### Only code-related windows on the screen.

This is important, especially in an open environment. People will look
at your screen, this is an undeniable fact. Everything in your line of
vision should be directly related to the code you are writing. If there
is a glimpse of anything else (Facebook, Twitter, email, etc.), it shows
that your attention is split, even if it isn't. To most people, if there
isn't code on the screen, you're taking a break. \
\

### Break off all virtual communication (with the exception of pairing).

My company uses [Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/) to communicate.
Utilizing a chat tool is a very convenient way to collaborate. It's also
a convenient way for people to interrupt you. Sign off. Simple as that.
If you absolutely have to be online ([especially remote
workers](http://www.toptal.com/freelance/how-to-work-remotely-and-still-be-the-best)),
set your status as "busy". I personally like to stay signed into chat
with my status set accordingly. If people see that I'm "busy", they tend
to leave me alone. \
\

### Headphones.

Any of the above suggestions can be further amplified by adding
headphones to the mix. You're effectively attempting to tune everyone
else out, and they notice. A person with headphones on is far less
approachable than one without. Use this to your advantage. \

 What are some of the ways you let people know you don't want to be
disrupted? Let me know in the comments!
