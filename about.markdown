Greetings!

I'm a software developer from Seattle who enjoys creating, breaking, and fixing web applications. I love the internet and the technologies built around it.

If I'm not at at the office, I'm probably in the gym attempting to lift heavy things, working on a side project (aka browsing Reddit), or exploring the great Pacific Northwest.

If you'd like to get in contact with me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/era86/) or drop me an [email](mailto:ancheta86@gmail.com).
