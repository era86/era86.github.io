Greetings!

I'm a web developer from Seattle who enjoys creating, breaking, and fixing web applications. I love the internet and the technologies built around it. I currently work at [Skytap](https://www.skytap.com/) as a backend software engineer. 

If I'm not at at the office, I'm probably at the gym attempting to lift heavy things, working on a side project (aka browsing Reddit), or exploring the great Pacific Northwest.

If you'd like to get in contact with me, you can find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/chedda86) or drop me an [email](mailto:ancheta86@gmail.com).
